# Calibur Smart Account Examples (EIP-7702)

## What is Calibur?

[Calibur](https://github.com/Uniswap/calibur) is a smart account implementation by Uniswap built for [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702). It turns any existing EOA into a full featured smart account through delegation. Your address stays the same, but gains new capabilities:

- **Multikey support** — Register multiple signing keys (EOA, passkey, raw P-256) with per-key settings
- **WebAuthn / Passkeys** — Native support for biometric authentication (Face ID, fingerprint, security keys)
- **Key expiration** — Set time limited keys for session based access
- **Per key hooks** — Attach custom validation logic to individual keys
- **Transaction batching** — Execute multiple calls in a single UserOperation
- **Admin / non-admin separation** — Only admin keys can manage the account's key configuration; non-admin keys can only sign regular transactions

## EntryPoint Versions

`Calibur7702Account` defaults to EntryPoint v0.8 (the canonical Calibur deployment by Uniswap).

You can override to EntryPoint v0.9 via the constructor to use features like Paymaster parallel signing (paymaster data excluded from the UserOperation hash) to reduce latency for users during signing. Example `01-upgrade-eoa.ts` demonstrates this override.

| Version | Singleton | EntryPoint |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| v0.8 (default) | `0x000000009B1D0aF20D8C6d0A44e162d11F9b8f00` | `0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032` |
| v0.9 (override) | `0x71032285A847c4311Eb7ec2E7A636aB94A9805Aa` | `0x4337084D9E255Ff0702461CF8895CE9E3b5Ff108` |

## Key Types

| Type | Enum | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `Secp256k1` | 2 | Standard Ethereum EOA keys |
| `WebAuthnP256` | 1 | Passkeys / biometric authentication |
| `P256` | 0 | Raw secp256r1 keys |

The root key (the EOA's own secp256k1 key) always has `keyHash = bytes32(0)` and is always admin. Keys registered via `createRegisterKeyMetaTransactions` are non-admin by default.

## Examples

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01-upgrade-eoa.ts` | Delegate an EOA to Calibur via EIP-7702, batch-mint 2 NFTs, sponsor gas with AllowAllPaymaster (EP v0.9 override) |
| `02-passkeys.ts` | Register a WebAuthn passkey, then sign and send a transaction with it |
| `03-manage-keys.ts` | List keys, register a secondary secp256k1 key, sign with it (`signUserOperationWithKey`), update its expiration, revoke it |

`01-upgrade-eoa.ts` uses `AllowAllPaymaster` with an EntryPoint v0.9 override for gas sponsorship. Examples `02` and `03` use the default EntryPoint v0.8 without a paymaster — the EOA must have some ETH for gas.

## Running

```bash
# From the repo root
npm install

# Set up .env (CHAIN_ID, NODE_URL, BUNDLER_URL are required)
# PRIVATE_KEY is optional — a new keypair is generated if not set

# Run in order (01 must run first to delegate the EOA)
npx ts-node eip-7702/calibur-account/01-upgrade-eoa.ts
npx ts-node eip-7702/calibur-account/02-passkeys.ts
npx ts-node eip-7702/calibur-account/03-manage-keys.ts
```

## AllowAllPaymaster

`01-upgrade-eoa.ts` uses `AllowAllPaymaster`, a development/testing paymaster deployed on EntryPoint v0.9 that sponsors all UserOperations unconditionally using a fixed magic signature. It is not intended for production use.

Address: `0x36A337b8b4cE5CF6ca1dDaeef73Da4928d714DF2`

## WebAuthn Note

The `webauthn.ts` file provides a simulated WebAuthn authenticator for Node.js. In a real browser application, replace it with the native `navigator.credentials` API — the Calibur signing flow (key registration, `createUserOperationHash`, `formatWebAuthnSignature`) remains the same.
